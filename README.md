# Hideko Portfolio
This is Hideko's portfolio website.

---

## Framework
I built it using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
At first I tried to develop simply with Next.js, but then I learned about Svelte and found it so fun and easy to develop with that I decided to go with it.

---

## Deploy
I deployed using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).
It's very fast and I highly reccomend it.

## Stack
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - A Simple, easy to write, fast JavaScript framework.
